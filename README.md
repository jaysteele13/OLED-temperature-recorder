## Summary

Small OLED project that displays temperature.

## Future Project Ideas

- Replace the Uno with a more powerful chip, add a more advanced GUI to the oled screen with buttons. 
- Perhaps with this chip add API capabilities to grab forecast for later on with animated symbols to represent the weather.
- Incorporate LLM and do some fun chatbot magic?
